title: 'Wave Function Collapse (WFC) R&D' 
tags: Algorithm Procedural
---

The Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm is an innovative approach to procedural generation, often applied in fields like game development, 3D modeling, and level design. Inspired by quantum mechanics, the algorithm operates by collapsing a "wave function" of possible configurations into a single, consistent result, much like how the quantum state of particles is observed in physics. The core idea of WFC is to generate patterns, textures, or levels that adhere to local constraints (like adjacency rules) while maintaining global consistency across the entire structure as shown below from a gif picked from the [WFC original repository](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse/tree/master).

The process starts with a grid or a defined space where each cell is in a superposition of all possible states (or patterns). As the algorithm progresses, it 'collapses' these possibilities one constantly reducing the system entropy until a unique configuration is achieved that satisfies the predefined constraints. It is a fascinating mix of randomness and determinism, allowing for the creation of complex structures that appear both organic and highly structured.

## Why It Is hot ?

A significant limitation of current AI generative technologies is that while they often produce content that is consistent on a local scale, this consistency diminishes when evaluated on a wider/global scale. The WFC algorithm also suffer from this (*potentialy only in its native implementation), as seen in the following screenshot of an infinite city generator, where the overall structure appears disconnected, despite local consistency.

The WFC algorithm provides more control over the output generation than generative AI workflows. Given



One possible solution to address these issues could be to implement nested, sequential WFC processes across multiple grid levels. Specifically, for a city, you would start by running a WFC to assign a neighborhood type to each cell. Then, within each neighborhood, you would create a new grid for the cell and assign house or block types. This recursive WFC process could continue, running repeatedly to populate the interiors of buildings, add furniture, and even place objects on the furniture to enhance realism.


One potential solution to address this would be to adapt the WFC algorithm to use a graph-based model instead of a pixel-based one. This would allow each cell or node to be connected to more cells or nodes beyond just the ones surrounding it. Today, weâ€™ll implement a graph-based model and use it to generate Sudoku grids. This serves as a great example, as each cell must also be unique within its subgrid, requiring the algorithm to consider non-adjacent cells as well. 

We will leverage design patterns such as the Observer and Memento patterns in the process. The Observer pattern will allow us to manage dependencies and notify components of changes, ensuring that the state of the grid is consistently updated. Meanwhile, the Memento pattern will enable us to capture and restore the state of the system at different points, making it easier to backtrack or undo changes during the grid generation process. These patterns will help structure the solution and maintain flexibility and efficiency as we implement the graph-based model.

## Code Implementation

### Installation & Imports
Install a package to handle the Observer design pattern, specifically [ReactiveX](https://pypi.org/project/reactivex/)
```
!pip install reactivex
```

Import  dependencies
```python

import multiprocessing
import copy
import math
import random

from reactivex import Observable, Observer, of, operators as ops
from reactivex.scheduler import ThreadPoolScheduler

# calculate cpu count, and use them to create a ThreadPoolScheduler
thread_count = multiprocessing.cpu_count()
thread_pool_scheduler = ThreadPoolScheduler(thread_count)

# increase recursion limit
# uncomment this if encountering recursion limit Exceptions
#import sys
#sys.setrecursionlimit(1500)
```

### WFC Components

At this stage, we can begin implementing the core components of the WFC algorithm:

- State: Holds all possible configurations that can be assigned to tiles.
- Tile: Represents the individual grid tiles, store edges and states information.
- Edge: Enables us to abstract the input shape, allowing support for any shape, not just grid-based inputs. It also facilitates the creation of more complex pattern relationships, like those seen in Sudoku.

#### State:

### WFC Logic Methods


Now that we have implemented the core WFC components, we need to create a few additional classes to handle the logic:

- WFCTileSelector: Contains methods for selecting the next tile to collapse.
- WFCStateResolver: Includes methods that resolve a tile to a specific state.
- WFCNeighborhoodCollapser: Manages the updating of connected tile states based on custom rules.
- WFCLogger: Provides methods for logging custom information during each epoch of the WFC process.

By designing our code this way, we can easily add new methods in the future to each class to handle different scenarios beyond generating Sudoku grids, all while maintaining a consistent structure.

        except ValueError:
            # If no tile has more than one state, the WFC has converged

By reaching this point, you should now have all the essential components needed to operate your WFC. In the following section, we will explore how to develop case-specific methods to interact with the code we've already written.

### Sudoku WFC Parts:

To specialize our WFC for generating Sudoku grids, we need to implement the following functions that will provide the necessary components:

- generate_sudoku_states: Returns all possible Sudoku states (values from 1 to 9).
- generate_sudoku_tiles: Returns instances of all Sudoku tiles (81 tiles for default grid's format).
- generate_sudoku_edges: Returns all the edges between Sudoku tiles that link them with adjacent tiles in the same row, column, and subgrid.

#### generate_sudoku_states

```python
def generate_sudoku_states():
    """
    Generates a list of all possible Sudoku states (values 1 through 9).

    This function creates a list of State objects, where each object represents 
    a possible value (from 1 to 9) for a Sudoku cell. The State object is initialized 
    with an id corresponding to the value and a state as a string representation of that value.

    Returns:
        list: A list of State objects, each representing a possible Sudoku value.
    """
    min_val = 1
    max_val = 9
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store the possible states
    all_possible_states = []

    # Loop through each number from min_val to max_val (inclusive)
    for i in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
        # Create a new State object for each number and append it to the list
        all_possible_states.append(State(id=i, state=str(i)))

    # Return the list containing all possible Sudoku states
    return all_possible_states

```

#### generate_sudoku_tiles
```python
