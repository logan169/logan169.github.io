Machine learning have done giant steps in past years thanks to the democratization of cloud computing infrastructure that allows to train models on hundreds/thousands TPU at the same time. Mastering this technology becomes a mandatory qualification for any company willing to stay competitive and innovative.

Machine learning splits up in different models categories, each of them being specialized into solving one type of problem. Most of this specialization is aquired through model's architecture, dataset that could be so huge that they are sometimes refered as data lake' and finaly hyperparameters cusmotization. One of the most available data for machine learning is pictures. Pictures machine learning model are so advanced that some people are turning their non visual datas like noise, mouse movement to images that could be ingested by those models to accomplish their clasiffication tasks. 

Today, I'll share some of the output I've produced using one specific machine learning algorithm that given two images will output a picture containing the content of one of the input wile being stylized by the second one. Here is a couple of examples to make this more visual.

Such technology could be applied at several different level in the cinema and video game industries in order to produced specifiv stylized textures or a whole movie as seen in .
